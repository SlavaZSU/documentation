# Return Orders

*As of Sales Pack v2.0.*

Return Orders are used to document product returned from customers. A Return Order can be created from a completed Sales Order. Multiple [Receipt Orders](receipt-orders.md) can be created from a single Return Order.

If the Warehouses feature is enabled, a Receipt Order record can be associated with a Warehouse the return is supposed to be shipped to.

Access to Return Orders is controlled by Roles.

It's possible to print a Return Order to PDF and send the PDF in an email.
